// Assignment: Greater Than Y
// Write a program that takes an array and returns the number of values in that array whose value is greater than y. For example, if array = [1,3, 5, 7] and y = 3, after your program is run it will print 2 (since there are two values in the array whose value is greater than 3).  Again make sure you come up with a simple base case and write instructions to solve that base case first and then test your instructions for other complicated cases. You can use a count function with this assignment.

function greaterThanY(arr, y) {
    var counter = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > y) {
            counter++;
        }
    }
    return counter;
}
console.log(greaterThanY([1, 3, 5, 7], 3));
